We have one big polaris 450 and a smaller polaris lite. Most of the time, I go out with my cousin and I would take the small one and he got the big one but we would switch half way through. However, next winter, I can't wait to just drive a snowmobile into town. To me a snowmoile at a Tim's is one of the most Canadian things ever"),

Anyway the fastest I've ever gone on a snomobile was 60mph (100kph). For those who do not know, the 'brake' on a snowmobile only stops the track turning so you have to be vary carful to not slide out of control. The picture above is part of a video that was taken of me at my cottage. We have a few jumps that we like to hit and I decided to have one filmed so that I could see if I got air or not. If you don't enjoy going fast and being slightly out of control I would recommend you not use a snowmobile.")

My first time was the grade 9 trip to bimmacombe where Devon and I spent most of the time falling down the hill as supposed to riding. The next time was Ted Pope day. This is where the mas shown above comes in. You know him, you love him, SIMON DUTIL!!!. This man taught me everything. He spent all of Ted Pope day teaching me how to acctually snowboard and by the end of the day, I was riding of jumps. Simon is an amazing man and the school will never be the same without him"),

They would be going up and down while I would be using a special rake to keep all the features in good condition. They would have music playing at the top and I had mine on a speaker about half way down so there was no place without some sick tunes. I will never forget the time spent withe these guys. ")

The picture is of me during the snow day we had to decorate the campus, I was called to set up some music in the grove. After  setting it all up I put on my favourite Christmas playlist and just danced the day away. I always have so much fun whenever I get to do tech around the campus and now, I am the one they call when tech is needed."),

After setting up the floor lights we decided to have a bit of fun. I would turn on some of the lights and Simon and AO would use random objects to make funny scenes. I love teching and I again learned everything from Simon. There are few people who have had such and impact on my life.")
