Most of the time, I go out with my cousin and I would take the small one and he got the big one but we would switch half way through. However, next winter, I can't wait to just drive a snowmobile into town. To me a snowmoile at a Tim's is one of the most Canadian things ever"),

Anyway the fastest I've ever gone on a snomobile was 60mph (100kph). For those who do not know, the 'brake' on a snowmobile only stops the track turning so you have to be vary carful to not slide out of control. The picture above is part of a video that was taken of me at my cottage. We have a few jumps that we like to hit and I decided to have one filmed so that I could see if I got air or not. If you don't enjoy going fast and being slightly out of control I would recommend you not use a snowmobile.")
